News Popularity Analysis and Prediction

  In the recent decades, internet has become a popular source for people to learn about news. And among all the news published online, some become really popular, but others do not. In this project, I aimed to predict whether a news article will become popular or not, based on some characterisitcs of the article, such as number of words, article topic, and etc.
  I used multiple machine learning models, such as KNN, Naive Bayes and Random Forest to perform classification, and compared the CV scores to determine the most appropriate model. Also, the important features that make a news article popular are determined by calculating the feature importance in the model.
