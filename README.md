# Online News Popularity Analysis and Prediction

  In the recent decades, internet has become a popular source for people to learn about news. And among all the news published online, some become really popular, but others do not. In this project, I aimed to predict whether a news article will become popular or not, based on some characteristics of the article, such as number of words, article topic, and etc. 
  
  I used multiple machine learning models, such as KNN, Naive Bayes, QDA, LDA, Logistic Regression and Random Forest to perform classification, and compared the CV scores to determine the most appropriate model. Also, the important features that make a news article popular are determined by calculating the feature importance in the model.

  The dataset (over 39000 observations) I used comes from a well-known news website called Mashable, and the dataset is provided by UCI machine learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+news+popularity).
